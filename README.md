## 🔧 How We Built PlantPedia
**Tech Stack**:  
- **Frontend**: Snap AR’s Spectacles with Interaction Kit & Script Component integration for user-friendly AR experiences.
- **Backend**: A custom API processes plant images, conducts health analysis, and compiles care guidelines.
- **APIs & Libraries**: 
  - **PlantNet API**: Identifies plant species from images.
  - **Wikipedia**: Extracts essential plant information.
  - **Google's Gemini LLM**: Curates growth recommendations.
  - **Custom Neural Networks & Logistic Models**: Evaluates plant health based on various indicators.

The captured frame is analyzed to identify the plant type, retrieve relevant information, and prompt Google’s Gemini for plant care tips. Results are displayed within world-anchored containers on the Snap AR Spectacles, giving users an immersive, hands-free plant care experience.
